## MyPhDMentor: Matching Algorithm Script

This document explain how to use the script for the matching algorithm used in the [MyPhDMentor](https://sites.google.com/view/myphdmentor/) project.

To make it work, proceed as follows.

First, adjust the flags in the Subscription form files as follows:
```
0 -> Correctly matched
1 -> Requires an assignment as Mentor
2 -> Requires an assignment as Mentee
3 -> Requires an assignment as both
```

Then,

1. Download the subscription file
2. The script requires the following Python libraries: `pandas` (for reading the CSV file), `numpy` (for vector operations), and `scipy` (for calculating the weighted cosine similarity and implementing the linear algorithm). Install if needed.
3. Clone this repository
4. Make the (sub)directories `output` and `log`
5. Run  
```
$ python src/main.py DOWNLOADED_CSV_FROM_GOOGLE_DRIVE
```
6. Check out the matching 

The weights assigned to the factors can be adjusted via the `config/weights.json` file.

The output generated by the script is a CSV file located at `output/matching.csv`, containing two columns (*mentee* and *mentor*) which list the email addresses of the paired individuals as determined by the algorithm.

*Important* : After the matching, don't forget to update the flags in the Google Drive file!
